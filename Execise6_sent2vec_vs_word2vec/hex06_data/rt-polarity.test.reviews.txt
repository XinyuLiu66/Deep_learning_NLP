a funny and well-contructed black comedy where the old adage " be careful what you wish for " is given a full workout .

director jay russell weighs down his capricious fairy-tale with heavy sentiment and lightweight meaning .
obvious , obnoxious and didactic burlesque .

because the film deliberately lacks irony , it has a genuine dramatic impact ; it plays like a powerful 1957 drama we've somehow never seen before .
as janice , eileen walsh , an engaging , wide-eyed actress whose teeth are a little too big for her mouth , infuses the movie with much of its slender , glinting charm .
even as i valiantly struggled to remain interested , or at least conscious , i could feel my eyelids . . . getting . . . very . . . heavy . . .
thurman and lewis are hilarious throughout .
the film just might turn on many people to opera , in general , an art form at once visceral and spiritual , wonderfully vulgar and sublimely lofty -- and as emotionally grand as life .
when you find yourself rooting for the monsters in a horror movie , you know the picture is in trouble .
rodriguez does a splendid job of racial profiling hollywood style--casting excellent latin actors of all ages--a trend long overdue .
too lazy to take advantage of its semi-humorous premise .
a playful iranian parable about openness , particularly the need for people of diverse political perspectives to get along despite their ideological differences .
the film's only missteps come from the script's insistence on providing deep emotional motivation for each and every one of abagnale's antics .
the best movie of its kind since 'brazil . ' lucas , take notes . this is how you use special effects .
serious and thoughtful .
. . . a weak and ineffective ghost story without a conclusion or pay off .
my oh my , is this an invigorating , electric movie .
the year's greatest adventure , and jackson's limited but enthusiastic adaptation has made literature literal without killing its soul -- a feat any thinking person is bound to appreciate .
this is what imax was made for : strap on a pair of 3-d goggles , shut out the real world , and take a vicarious voyage to the last frontier -- space .
chalk it up to my adoration for both de niro and murphy , but i had a pretty good time with this movie - despite its myriad flaws .
with its dogged hollywood naturalism and the inexorable passage of its characters toward sainthood , windtalkers is nothing but a sticky-sweet soap .
at once subtle and visceral , the film never succumbs to the trap of the maudlin or tearful , offering instead with its unflinching gaze a measure of faith in the future .
move over bond ; this girl deserves a sequel .
an elegant film with often surprising twists and an intermingling of naivet√© and sophistication .
a big , gorgeous , sprawling swashbuckler that delivers its diversions in grand , uncomplicated fashion .
the picture is a primer on what happens when lack of know-how mixes with lack of give-a-damn .
i found the ring moderately absorbing , largely for its elegantly colorful look and sound .
a film of ideas and wry comic mayhem .
violent , vulgar and forgettably entertaining .
it's never laugh-out-loud funny , but it is frequently amusing .
one of those strained caper movies that's hardly any fun to watch and begins to vaporize from your memory minutes after it ends .
watching harris ham it up while physically and emotionally disintegrating over the course of the movie has a certain poignancy in light of his recent death , but boyd's film offers little else of consequence .
exploring value choices is a worthwhile topic for a film -- but here the choices are as contrived and artificial as kerrigan's platinum-blonde hair .

the editing is chaotic , the photography grainy and badly focused , the writing unintentionally hilarious , the direction unfocused , the performances as wooden .
with elements cribbed from lang's metropolis , welles' kane , and eisenstein's potemkin , the true wonder of rintar√¥'s metropolis is the number of lasting images all its own .
two big things are missing -- anything approaching a visceral kick , and anything approaching even a vague reason to sit through it all .
. . . by the time it's done with us , mira nair's new movie has its audience giddy with the delight of discovery , of having been immersed in a foreign culture only to find that human nature is pretty much the same all over .
costner's warm-milk persona is just as ill-fitting as shadyac's perfunctory directing chops , and some of the more overtly silly dialogue would sink laurence olivier .
there's back-stabbing , inter-racial desire and , most importantly , singing and dancing .
merely as a technical , logistical feat , russian ark marks a cinematic milestone .
consider the film a celluloid litmus test for the intellectual and emotional pedigree of your date and a giant step backward for a director i admire .
. . . think of it as american pie on valium .
sometimes this modest little number clicks , and sometimes it doesn't .
boring and meandering .
[taylor] takes us on a ride that's consistently surprising , easy to watch -- but , oh , so dumb .
it never rises to its clever what-if concept .

bittersweet comedy/drama full of life , hand gestures , and some really adorable italian guys .
